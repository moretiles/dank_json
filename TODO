* Get interface working.

* Make sure JSON dictionaries are sorted in the same order as input.
* Add error queue.
* Use wchar_t for strings to properly handle 2 byte escapes (like \xabcd).
* Use global zero initialized node to populate initial dictionary so we only "waste" memory on pointers, not nodes
