Core functionality
* Split into public and private header
    * Define jsonLiteral JSON_TRUE, JSON_FALSE inside the private header. Mark them as extern within the public header.
    * Move jsonUpdate family of functions to privat header, they are useful but redundent when jsonCreate can update and create if a node does not exist.
* Make it so that the head of an array keeps track of it's parent using prev so calling jsonDelete communicates to the parent properly.
* Define proper jsonClose function to close file and terminate associated nodes.
* Give structs better names in the public interface.

Nice to have:
* Use prev and next to connect together active nodes in a dictionary (saving deallocation time).
* Make sure JSON dictionaries are sorted in the same order as input. (can use the existing prev and next pointers).
* Use wchar_t for strings to properly handle 2 byte escapes (like \xabcd).
