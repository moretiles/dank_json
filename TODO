Progress map

* Add in shallow copy and depp copy variants.
* Reconsider whether some functions should have *l/*v variants.
* Give structs better names in the public interface

CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING

* Make sure JSON dictionaries are sorted in the same order as input.
* Make sure we allocate dictionaries using a pool.
* Try out a malloc bins style string allocation method.
* Add error queue.
* Use wchar_t for strings to properly handle 2 byte escapes (like \xabcd).
* Use global zero initialized node to populate initial dictionary so we only "waste" memory on pointers, not nodes
* Store linked list of active nodes in pool so that most of the time the program spends is not checking if nonexistant nodes need to be deallocated
