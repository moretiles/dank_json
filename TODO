Progress map

Core functionality
* Make it so that the head of an object keeps track of it's parent using prev
* Make jsonDelete aware of the fact that the head node for arrays/dictionaries needs to communicate it has been deleted the parent properly. Storing the reference to the parent should already be done.
* Use wchar_t for strings to properly handle 2 byte escapes (like \xabcd).
* Split into public and private header
    * Define jsonLiteral JSON_TRUE, JSON_FALSE inside the private header. Mark them as extern within the public header.
    * Move jsonUpdate family of functions to privat header, they are useful but redundent when jsonCreate can update and create if a node does not exist.
* Give api and structs better names in the public interface.
* Document how functions work in header.
* Provide examples in README.
