Core functionality
* Handle memory leaks for jsonCreate family
* Write tests for the jsonCreate, jsonRead, jsonUpdate families.
* Give structs better names in the public interface.

Nice oh have:
* Make sure JSON dictionaries are sorted in the same order as input.
* Use wchar_t for strings to properly handle 2 byte escapes (like \xabcd).
* Use prev and next to connect together active nodes in a dictionary (saving deallocation time).

Maybe:
* Make sure we allocate dictionaries using a pool.
* Use global zero initialized node to populate initial dictionary so we only "waste" memory on pointers, not nodes
